This website serves as my professional portsolio, linking to my GitHub as well as Linkdin pages.  I chose to start by useing a template from startbootstrap.com, then applying numerous changes to achive the style and functionality I desiered. This requiered exploring their stylesheets, changing classes and minor structure.

To see the differences, visit their site at https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/.
